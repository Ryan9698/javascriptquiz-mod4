# Javascript Quiz - Module 4 Challenge

## Description

This quiz was designed to be a quiz to test a user's basic understanding of JavaScript. It was a cool experience because it was entirely coded from scratch and used vanilla JavaScript in a way we haven't worked with too often. While basic, I tried to add a couple different features to it to surpass the requirements such as utilizing local storage to render a list of high scores on a separate html file so a user can see if they have improved. At this time there are limited questions but it would be cool to go back and add more questions and features at a later date. I primarily learned a lot about styling through this assignment and the way to link files in different ways. Using node, you get used to module exports but I learned you can source several JavaScript files in your html file, allowing you to organize your code and keep script files from getting too large. I also learned how to incorporate dynamic features in a way I wasn't comfortable with, such as the timer and current score.
